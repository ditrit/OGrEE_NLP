## WHAT IS DONE

All the main methods are implemented and functional, you can test the plugin in its current state with the __*ogree_main_test.ipynb*__ file.

## WHAT IS TO DO

- All the *TODO* in the code (mostly in __*ogree_main.py*__)

- Add the solver to the main process

- Implement understanding of space-related instructions (e.g. "Add a rack 2.3m from the left wall").  
First thought : should be detected with "from" keyword

- Integration to the CLI with enable/disable functionnality (because this plugin takes time)

- Implement understanding of several object placement (e.g. "Add 4 racks at position 5 5").
